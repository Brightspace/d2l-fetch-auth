# d2l-fetch-auth

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/d2l-fetch-auth.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/d2l-fetch-auth)

Provides a middleware function for wrapping a window.Request object with d2l authentication for use with d2l-fetch.

## Installation

Install from NPM:

```shell
npm install d2l-fetch-auth
```

## Usage

Reference the script in your html after your reference to `d2l-fetch` (see [here](https://github.com/Brightspace/d2l-fetch) for details on d2l-fetch):

```html
<script type="module">
import auth from 'd2l-fetch-auth/d2l-fetch-auth.js';
</script>
```

Alternatively, if you are making requests from within the context of an iFramed Free Range Application (iFRA), reference the framed script:

```html
<script type="module">
import auth from 'd2l-fetch-auth/d2l-fetch-auth-framed.js';
</script>
```

This will import the `auth` middleware function.

### Auth

Install the `auth` middleware to d2lfetch via the `use` function and then start making your requests.

```js
d2lfetch.use({name: 'auth', fn: auth});

const response = await d2lfetch.fetch(
	new Request('http://example.com/api/entity/1')
);
```

## Versioning & Releasing

> TL;DR: Commits prefixed with `fix:` and `feat:` will trigger patch and minor releases when merged to `main`. Read on for more details...

The [semantic-release GitHub Action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/main/semantic-release) is called from the `release.yml` GitHub Action workflow to handle version changes and releasing.

### Version Changes

All version changes should obey [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules:
1. **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

The next version number will be determined from the commit messages since the previous release. Our semantic-release configuration uses the [Angular convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular) when analyzing commits:
* Commits which are prefixed with `fix:` or `perf:` will trigger a `patch` release. Example: `fix: validate input before using`
* Commits which are prefixed with `feat:` will trigger a `minor` release. Example: `feat: add toggle() method`
* To trigger a MAJOR release, include `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines in the footer of the commit message
* Other suggested prefixes which will **NOT** trigger a release: `build:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:` and `test:`. Example: `docs: adding README for new component`

To revert a change, add the `revert:` prefix to the original commit message. This will cause the reverted change to be omitted from the release notes. Example: `revert: fix: validate input before using`.

### Releases

When a release is triggered, it will:
* Update the version in `package.json`
* Tag the commit
* Create a GitHub release (including release notes)
* Deploy a new package to NPM

### Releasing from Maintenance Branches

Occasionally you'll want to backport a feature or bug fix to an older release. `semantic-release` refers to these as [maintenance branches](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/workflow-configuration#maintenance-branches).

Maintenance branch names should be of the form: `+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x`.

Regular expressions are complicated, but this essentially means branch names should look like:
* `1.15.x` for patch releases on top of the `1.15` release (after version `1.16` exists)
* `2.x` for feature releases on top of the `2` release (after version `3` exists)
